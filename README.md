# Vehicle Price Prediction Project
Introduction
Vehicles vary widely in price depending on their make, model, year, condition, specifications, and features. Accurate price prediction plays a crucial role for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. It helps ensure fair pricing, improve sales strategies, and build trust in online vehicle marketplaces. With the help of machine learning models, we aim to predict vehicle prices based on various technical and descriptive attributes.

This project utilizes a dataset containing detailed vehicle specifications. By analyzing this data and training multiple regression models, we aim to estimate the selling price of a vehicle effectively and provide actionable insights for price optimization in the used and new car markets.



# Methodology
The process begins with data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Following this, exploratory data analysis is performed to understand trends, feature importance, and potential outliers.
We then train multiple regression models to predict the price of vehicles. The models are evaluated based on RÂ² score and error metrics to assess their performance. The best-performing model is used to make final predictions on unseen data.

# Algorithms Used
The following machine learning algorithms were applied and compared in this project:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regression (DT)
Random Forest Regression (RF)
Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR)
XGBoost Regressor
